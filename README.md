## Lottery-Solidity-React

I've created Smart Contract for playing lottery and React app that communicates with it.
Players can enter the lottery, contribute amount of ether, and Contract manager can execute
the "pick winner" command, where all the pool money goes to randomly chosen winner.

Technologies I've used are:

  - Solidity
  - React
  - Web3
  - Infura using Rinkby
  - Metamask
